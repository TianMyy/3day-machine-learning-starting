# 3day-machine-learning-starting
code demos and notes for a starting course on machine learning, strenghten my foundation on ML, learning from following link: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nt411r7tj?t=98&amp;amp;p=23

codes in English version, notes in Chinese version

**Day 1 demos include following content:**
  1. sklaern dataset usage 
  2. dictionary feature extraction (DicVectorizer)
  3. text feature extraction (CountVectorizer)
  4. cut word usage (jieba)
  5. use TF-IDF to process text feature extraction
  6. Normalization
  7. Standardization
  8. filter features with low variance (pearsonr \ VarianceThreshold)
  9. PCA dimension reduction (PCA)

**Day 2 demos include following content:**
  1. use KNN algorithm to classify the iris category
  2. use KNN algorithm to classify the iris category, add grid search and cross validation
  3. use Naive Bayes to classify the data
  4. use Decision Tree to classify the iris dataset
